However, you can share music with your friends inside the app by uploading projects to your account. Or, if desired, record music using the built-in screen recording application on your phone, and then extract the audio track from the video in the online service. 

2. Q: What sounds can be uploaded to the app? 
A: Sounds in mp3, ogg, wav, aac, 3gp or flac format are suitable for download. The length of the sound must not exceed 5.6 seconds. 

3. Q: What should I do if the audio tracks on the screen have shifted relative to each other? 
A: Scroll all the way to the end or start of the project. To avoid this error, do not scroll audio tracks too abruptly.
